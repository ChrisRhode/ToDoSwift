# ToDoSwift
This is a implementation of ToDo2 (Objective C) in Swift.  It is a work in progress.
The code has progressed to the point that new items can be added at any level, all items added are displayed, and search works, with ability to back up the item tree level by level.
The intent is for the app to look and feel the same as the Objective C version
There are changes/improvements in the way the code works, for example, To Do List "items" are abstracted into a class.  I plan to further this when I implement editing of items, by making the ToDoItem class be both the object that stores all properties of a class AND be loadable as a view to edit the item.

# ToDoSwift
This is a implementation of ToDo2 (Objective C) in Swift.  It is a work in progress.
The code has progressed to the point that new items can be added at the top level and all items added are displayed
The intent is for the app to look and feel the same as the Objective C version
There are changes/improvements in the way the code works, for example, To Do List "items" are abstracted into a class.
